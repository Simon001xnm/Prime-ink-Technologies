## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#FF0000) to convey energy and importance.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Black (#000000) to highlight important calls to action and create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Arial', a grotesque sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, geometric icons for navigation and product features. Icons should primarily be black with red highlights.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout with plenty of white space for a professional look. Use black and red elements sparingly to guide the user's eye.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction without being distracting. Use red sparingly in animations to draw attention.
